# Scripts

This repo contains small and simple scripts I made for my personal use. Those are probably useless as is but should be easily reusable.

**Note**: As of May 2022, all scripts were moved to the [*archive*](https://github.com/Sudiukil/Scripts/tree/archive) branch and only actively used and maintained scripts will remain on *master*.

Everything in this repo is licensed under the WTFPL 2.0 license, see [LICENSE](https://github.com/Sudiukil/Scripts/blob/master/LICENSE) for complete copy.
